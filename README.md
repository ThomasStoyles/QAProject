must have minimum of two tables within it. We are also required to 
model a relationship.

you will use for you project as well as a detailed Risk Assessment.

practices and design principles, that meets the requirements set on
your Trello Board.

automated tests for validation of the application. You must
provide high test coverage in your backend and provide consistent
reports and evidence to support a TDD approach.

* A functioning frount-end website and integrated APIs, using Flask
